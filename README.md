# spam-email

Use extract-combine to program a simple machine learning algorithm called na ̈ıve Bayes classification, and use this classification algorithm to automatically label news articles with categories (such as “econonmics” or “government/social”); another typical application is spam filtering, labeling an email with categories “spam” or “not spam”. The first phase of classification is training, where word frequency counts are extracted from a collection of documents that have been labeled with categories. In the next phase, these frequencies are used to predict the category for unlabeled documents. Na ̈ıve Bayes classification is called “na ̈ıve” because it treats a document as a multiset of words, ignoring the order of the words and other dependencies. It is called “Bayes” because a fact about probabilities called Bayes’ rule is the main component of the method.
